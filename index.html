			<h2>Poetry, Je T'aime</h2>
			<p>For the last ten years, I've studied poetry as well as creative nonfiction.  I love poets who shy away from "pretty" observations and dull lyricism; I want to feel like I've been punched in the gut when I'm done reading!  I have my BA in creative writing and have been published in several literary journals and anthologies.  As a reminder to myself to keep writing, and as a sign of my love of my craft, I have three literary tattoos!  This one is from Denis Johnson's poem "From a Berkeley Notebook":</p>

			<h2>Critical Hit!</h2>
			<p>Roll for initiative, because my bardic gnome Peanut is about to MESS THINGS UP.  I'm an avid player of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other tabletop RPGs, and I currently play a campaign every week as Peanut, a chaotic good teenage bard who plays the jaw harp and accidentally part demon, despite restlessly fighting for good.  Mostly, I like RPGs because I think that collaborative storytelling and problem-solving is an incredible way to exercise your brain--and a good excuse to have a few beers with friends.</p>
